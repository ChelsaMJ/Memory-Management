# Memory Management Simulation

This project is a simulation of a computer's memory management system. The program includes a memory manager that uses then **First-Fit** memory allocation algorithm to allocate memory blocks to processes. It also includes a mechanism for deallocating memory when a process completes. The simulation runs for a set number of time units and records metrics related to memory fragmentation and wasted memory blocks.

## Project Overview

### Features

1. **Memory Allocation:** The program allocates memory blocks to processes using the First-Fit allocation algorithm.

2. **Memory Deallocation:** Memory is deallocated when a process completes, ensuring efficient memory utilization.

3. **Fragmentation:** The simulation records the average amount of fragmentation at the end of each time unit. Fragmentation occurs when small, unused memory blocks are scattered throughout the memory space.

4. **Wasted Memory:** The program also records the number of wasted memory blocks at the end of each time unit, indicating memory blocks no longer in use.

5. **Simulation Results:** The simulation provides results, including the average fragmentation and wasted memory blocks, at the end of each time unit.
